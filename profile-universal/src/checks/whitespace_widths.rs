        If the space and nbspace glyphs have different widths, then Google Workspace
        has problems with the font.

        The nbspace is used to replace the space character in multiple situations in
        documents; such as the space before punctuation in languages that do that. It
        avoids the punctuation to be separated from the last word and go to next line.

        This is automatic substitution by the text editors, not by fonts. It's also used
        by designers in text composition practice to create nicely shaped paragraphs.
        If the space and the nbspace are not the same width, it breaks the text
        composition of documents.
